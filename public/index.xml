      <description>Classes: Choose Your Path Today, I want to introduce you to something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on: Class Paths. This is an initiative designed to gamify the learning process, enhance immersion and make your journey here at Arkiwaal more engaging.
Everyone learns in their own unique way. That&amp;rsquo;s why I came up with three distinct classes (for now) that you can choose from (you may choose instead to be matched to a class), each with its own strengths and unique style.</description>

      <description>Arkiwaal Begins Welcome to Arkiwaal.
What is Arkiwaal? The word &amp;ldquo;Arkiwaal&amp;rdquo; was conceived on a whim, inspired by the term &amp;ldquo;ARC&amp;rdquo;. My intention was to give it a Central European flavor. Arkiwaal is designed as a platform to share my learnings in the tech world, with a special emphasis on cyber security.
Gamifying Everything Currently, I am working on creating a course that will be freely accessible to all (no sign-up required).</description>
