# Classes: Choose Your Path

Today, I want to introduce you to something that I've been working on: Class Paths. This is an initiative designed to gamify the learning process, enhance immersion and make your journey here at Arkiwaal more engaging.

Everyone learns in their own unique way. That's why I came up with three distinct classes (for now) that you can choose from (you may choose instead to be matched to a class), each with its own strengths and unique style. 

## The Wanderer

First, we have the Wanderer. Known as the adventurer or the traveller, the Wanderer is for those who love to explore new territories and learn at their own pace. If you love the thrill of discovery and learning something new every day, then this class is for you.

## The Samurai

Next, we have the Samurai. This class is for those who fight with honour. This class may also be referred to as the Cyber Samurai. If you are passionate about cyber security and want to uphold the principles of integrity and justice in the digital world, then the Samurai class will suit you perfectly.

## The Ghost

Lastly, we have the Ghost. This class is for those who prefer to work behind the scenes, invisible to everyone. If you love solving problems quietly and efficiently, then the Ghost class is your perfect match.

These classes are designed to cater to different learning styles and interests. They will guide your journey, helping you navigate through the wealth of knowledge available. Remember, the goal here is not just to learn, but to enjoy the process of learning.

## What is Gamification?

Gamification in education is a developing approach for increasing learners' motivation and engagement by incorporating game design elements in educational environments. With the growing popularity of gamification and yet mixed opinions about its successful application in educational contexts, the current review is aiming to shed a more realistic light on the research in this field.

To help you choose your class, each class will come with a detailed description of what you can expect, the kind of content that will be focused on, and what skills or interests would best suit each class. This way, you can choose the class that aligns best with your learning style and interests.

So, are you ready to choose your path and embark on this exciting journey of learning? Choose your class and let's get started on this incredible adventure together. This was Class Paths.
